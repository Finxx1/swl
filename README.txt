swl - simple window library

swl is a library that provides a thin abstraction layer over windowing on
different platforms, to enable cross-platform application development. It is
written in C, compatible with C++, and should be usable by most languages via
FFI.

For instructions on building, see INSTALL.txt. For API documentation, see either
TUTORIAL.txt or REFERENCE.txt.

swl is licensed under the ISC license, a very permissive license that allows for
commercial use. It is asked that if you add features to this source code, you
send us a patch to be added to the main project, though this is not required.
