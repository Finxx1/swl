For Windows:

Building on Windows can be done with either MSVC or MinGW. If you have a POSIX
compatible shell, you can run the configure script in the root of the project.
If you do not, run the configure.bat file, also in the root of the project.

$ ./configure

OR

D:\swl>configure.bat

These scripts will generate a Makefile for your platform. They will detect the
toolchain and make a POSIX and NMAKE compatible Makefile. From there, run make.

$ make

OR
D:\swl>nmake

Note: both scripts generate NMAKE compatible Makefiles, and both scripts detect
the toolchain you are using.
