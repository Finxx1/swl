The official way to compile swl is with the Makefile. Open a developer command
prompt, change directory to the root of the project, and run 'nmake'. It will
build both a static and dynamic library.

If you aren't using MSVC, you can still build swl; you just need to bring your
own makefile. Hint: you can probably just 'cc -c src/*.c', all platform-specific
code is guarded with OS-specific macro ifdefs.
